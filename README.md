Readings in Databases, BigData

A list of papers essential to understanding databases and building new data systems. 
<br>
The list is curated and maintained by BlueseaLi, but it came from Reynold Xin (@rxin, https://github.com/rxin/db-readings) initally. 
<br>
BlueseaLi added some new documents.Â 
<br>
If you think a paper should be part of this list, please submit a pull request. It might take a while since I need to go over the paper.

If you are reading this and taking the effort to understand these papers, we would love to talk to you about opportunities at Databricks.

This essay walks readers through all components essential to relational database systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/Relational-Model-Codd.pdf">A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks</a> (1970): Codd's argument for data independence (from 1970), a fundamental concept in relational databases. Despite the current NoSQL trend, I believe ideas from this paper are becoming increasingly important in massively parallel data systems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/ARIES.pdf">ARIES: A Transaction Recovery Method Supporting Fine-Granularity Locking and Partial Rollbacks Using Write-Ahead Logging</a> (1992): The first algorithm that actually works: it supports concurrent execution of transactions without losing data even in the presence of failures. This paper is very hard to read because it mixes a lot of low level details in the explanation of the high level algorithm. Perhaps try understand ARIES (log recovery) by reading a database textbook before attempting to read this paper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/B-tree.pdf">Efficient Locking for Concurrent Operations on B-Trees</a> (1981) and The <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/R-tree.pdf">R*-tree: An Efficient and Robust Access Method for Points and Rectangles</a> (1990): B-Tree is a core data structure in databases (not just relational). It is optimized and has a low read amplification factor for random lookups of on-disk data. R-tree is an extension of B-tree to support lookups of multi-dimensional data, e.g. geodata.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.duke.edu/courses/spring03/cps216/papers/oneil-quass-1997.pdf">Improved Query Performance with Variant Indexes</a> (1997): Analytical databases and OLTP databases require different trade-offs. These are reflected in the choices of indexing data structures. This paper talks about a number of index data structures more suitable for analytical databases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/OCC-Optimistic-Concurrency-Control.pdf">On Optimistic Methods for Concurrency Control</a> (1981): There are two ways to support concurrency. The first is the pessimistic way, i.e. to lock shared data preemptively. This paper explains an alternatively to locking called Optimistic Concurrency Control. Optimistic approaches assume conflicts are rare and executes transactions without acquiring locks. Before committing the transactions, the database system checks for conflicts and aborts/restarts transactions if conflicts arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/SystemR-Optimizer.pdf">Access Path Selection in a Relational Database Management System</a> (1979): The basics of query optimization. SQL is declarative, i.e. you specify using a query language what data you want, not how you want it. There are usually multiple ways (query plans) of executing a query. The database system examines multiple plans and decides on an optimal one (best-effort). This process is called query optimization. The traditional way of doing query optimization is to have a cost-model for different access methods and query plans. This paper explains the cost-model and a dynamic programming algorithm to pick the best plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/Eddies.pdf">Eddies: Continuously Adaptive Query Processing</a> (2000): Traditional query optimization (and the cost model used) is static. There are two problems with the traditional model. First, it is hard to build the cost model absent of data statistics. Second, query execution environment might change in long running queries and a static approach cannot capture the change. Analogous to fluid dynamics, this paper proposes a set of techniques that optimize query execution dynamically. I don't think ideas in Eddies have made their way into commercial systems yet, but the paper is very refreshing to read and might become more important now.</p>

GFS is an append-only distributed file system for large sequential reads (data-intensive applications). BigTable is high-performance distributed data store that builds on GFS. One way to think about it is that GFS is optimized for high throughput, and BigTable explains how to build a low-latency data store on top of GFS. Some of these might have been replaced by newer proprietary technologies internal to Google, but the ideas stand.</p>

It does one thing, and does it really well: how to look up the location of a key in a completely distributed setting (peer-to-peer) using consistent hashing. The Dynamo paper explains how to build a distributed key-value store using Chord. Note some design decisions change from Chord to Dynamo, e.g. finger table O(logN) vs O(N), because in Dynamo's case, Amazon has more control over nodes in a data center, while Chord assumes peer-to-peer nodes in wide area networks.</p>

Dremel is a massively parallel analytical database used at Google for ad-hoc queries. The system runs on thousands of nodes to process terabytes of data in seconds. It applies columnar storage to complex, nested data structures. The paper talks a lot about the nested data structure support, and is a bit light on the details of the query execution. Note that a number of open source projects are claiming they are building "Dremel". The Dremel system achieves low-latency through massive parallelism and columnar storage, so the model doesn't necessarily make sense outside Google since very few companies in the world can afford thousands of nodes for ad-hoc queries.</p>

Spark exposes a distributed memory abstraction called RDD, which is an immutable collection of records distributed across a cluster's memory. RDDs can be transformed using MapReduce style computations. The RDD abstraction can be orders of magnitude more efficient for workloads that exhibit strong temporal locality, e.g. query processing and iterative machine learning.

<p><a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/%7Erxin/db-papers/WarehouseScaleComputing.pdf">The Datacenter as a Computer: An Introduction to the Design of Warehouse-Scale Machines</a>: Google's Luiz AndrÃ© Barroso and Urs HÃ¶lzle explains the basics of data center hardware and software for warehouse-scale computing. There is an <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2019527&amp;bnc=1">accompanying video</a>. The video talks about the importance of cutting long-tail latency in massively parallel systems. The other key idea is the disaggregation of resources. Technologies such as GFS/HDFS already disaggregate disks because of high network bandwidth, but yet to see the same trend applying to DRAMs because that'd require low-latency networking.</p>

Hellerstein provide a summary of 35 years of data model proposals, grouped into 9 different eras. The paper discusses the proposals of each era, and show that there are only a few basic data modeling ideas, and most have been around a long time. Later proposals inevitably bear a strong resemblance to certain earlier proposals.</p>
